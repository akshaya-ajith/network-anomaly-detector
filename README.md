# Network Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is a **Network Anomaly Detection System** that analyzes captured network traffic (`.pcap` files) and detects abnormal behavior using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates the application of cybersecurity concepts and AI/software development skills, including packet analysis, feature extraction, and anomaly detection.

The system can be used to:
- Identify unusual patterns in network traffic.
- Detect potential malicious activity or network intrusions.
- Serve as a learning tool for AI-based network security solutions.

## Features
- Capture and parse `.pcap` files using Python.
- Extract meaningful features from network packets (e.g., protocol, packet size, timestamps, IP addresses, TCP flags).
- Train machine learning models (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) for anomaly detection.
- Generate reports highlighting anomalous traffic.
- Optional real-time monitoring support.
